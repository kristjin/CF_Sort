Shuffle function is just a basic modification of the code Brook did in class.
I still do  not understand how 3 variables are passed to his use of setInterval.   My  use is very different.

I  did the code for the insertion sort.  I chose insertion sort because it's extremely simple and therefore, in my mind,
easier to implement on the screen.
