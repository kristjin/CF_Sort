Shuffle function is just a basic modification of the code Brook did in class.
I still do  not understand how 3 variables are passed to his use of setInterval.   My  use is very different.

I  did the code for the insertion sort.  I chose insertion sort because it's extremely simple and therefore, in my mind,
easier to implement on the screen.

lol, what a great idea that it would be "easy"  It wasn't!

I learned SO MUCH doing this project.  I still think there's a lot I can do to make this cooler.
I may spend some time on it going forward for practice.

I had a lot of issues with the timer function, as usual.  And a lot of scope  issues  I had  to learn to watch for.

But in the end, this works, and is kinda neat.  I'd like to do more animationy stuff with it now.
